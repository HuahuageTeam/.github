## About Us
**Huahuage (椛椛阁)** is a team that previously focused on developing QQ bots and their plugins. However, we are now reorganizing the team with the goal of creating more widely applicable open-source software in the future. We are committed to contributing to the open-source community and helping others grow through our work.

## Current Projects
Our primary project at the moment is **CiChat**, a simple chat software designed for educational purposes. Through the development and operation of CiChat, we aim to help our team members gain valuable experience and knowledge.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Java + Spring
- **Frontend/Desktop Application**: Electron + Vue
